# 🎯 LangGraph Basics: Build Stateful AI Workflows Progressively

## Master the Fundamentals of Graph-Based AI - From Imports to Research Agent

Welcome to Master LangGraph Basics! Learn to build AI applications step by step, starting from basic imports and progressing to a complete research assistant with multiple tools.

## 🎯 Lab Objective

**Your Mission:** Master LangGraph fundamentals through 7 progressive tasks, building from simple imports to a complete research agent with calculator and web search capabilities.

## 📚 What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a framework for building **stateful, multi-step AI workflows** using graphs. Unlike simple LLM chains, LangGraph gives you explicit control over how data flows through your application, enabling complex decision-making, loops, and conditional routing.

## 🏗️ What You'll Build

A progressive series of graphs that demonstrates:
1. **Basic Imports** - Foundation setup with StateGraph, END, TypedDict
2. **Node Functions** - State transformation basics without graphs
3. **Connected Edges** - Your first complete graph
4. **Multi-step Flows** - Document processing workflow
5. **Conditional Routing** - Dynamic decision-making
6. **Calculator Tool** - First LLM integration
7. **Research Agent** - Complete assistant with calculator + web search

## 📋 Lab Structure (7 Progressive Tasks)

### Task 1: Understanding Imports 📦
**File:** `task_1_understanding_imports.py` (44 lines)

**Concept:** Master the essential imports needed for LangGraph

**What You'll Do:**
- Import StateGraph and END from langgraph.graph
- Import TypedDict from typing
- Define your first State class with messages list
- Understand the building blocks WITHOUT execution

**3 TODOs:**
- **Line 10:** Import modules: `from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END`
- **Line 14:** Import TypedDict: `from typing import TypedDict`
- **Line 19:** Define messages field: `messages: list`

**Key Learning:** StateGraph creates workflows, END marks completion, State holds data

---

### Task 2: Creating Nodes ⚙️
**File:** `task_2_creating_nodes.py` (61 lines)

**Concept:** Learn that nodes are functions that transform state

**What You'll Do:**
- Create greet_node that generates a greeting
- Create enhance_node that adds decorations
- Test nodes manually WITHOUT a graph
- See how nodes return partial state updates

**3 TODOs:**
- **Line 20:** Return greeting: `return {"greeting": greeting}`
- **Line 28:** Return enhanced greeting: `return {"greeting": enhanced}`

**Key Learning:** Nodes are functions that take state and return PARTIAL updates

---

### Task 3: Connecting Edges 🔗
**File:** `task_3_connecting_edges.py` (70 lines)

**Concept:** Build your first complete graph with edges

**What You'll Do:**
- Create your first StateGraph
- Add nodes using add_node
- Connect nodes with add_edge
- Set entry point and compile
- Run your first workflow!

**3 TODOs:**
- **Line 33:** Create StateGraph: `workflow = StateGraph(State)`
- **Line 38:** Add enhance node: `workflow.add_node("enhance", enhance_node)`
- **Line 43:** Connect edges: `workflow.add_edge("greet", "enhance")`

**Key Learning:** StateGraph + add_node + add_edge = Complete workflow!

---

### Task 4: Complete Flow 🎯
**File:** `task_4_complete_flow.py` (86 lines)

**Concept:** Multi-step document processing workflow

**What You'll Do:**
- Build a 3-step workflow: outline → draft → review
- See state accumulation across multiple nodes
- Each node builds on previous results
- Complete multi-step processing

**3 TODOs:**
- **Line 37:** Return final: `return {"final": final}`
- **Line 48:** Add review node: `workflow.add_node("review", review_node)`
- **Line 54:** Connect to review: `workflow.add_edge("draft", "review")`

**Key Learning:** Multi-node workflows process data in stages with state accumulation

---

### Task 5: Conditional Routing 🔀
**File:** `task_5_conditional_routing.py` (115 lines)

**Concept:** Dynamic path selection based on state

**What You'll Do:**
- Analyze query length to determine routing
- Create router function that returns node names
- Route to quick_response or detailed_response
- Master add_conditional_edges

**3 TODOs:**
- **Line 27:** Router condition: `if state["query_length"] == "short":`
- **Line 57:** Set entry point: `workflow.set_entry_point("analyze")`
- **Line 66:** Map routing: `"detailed": "detailed"`

**Key Learning:** Router examines state → Returns node name → Graph routes dynamically

---

### Task 6: Calculator Tool 🧮
**File:** `task_6_calculator_tool.py` (124 lines)

**Concept:** First LLM integration as a calculator

**What You'll Do:**
- Classify queries as math or non-math
- Route to calculator_node for math queries
- Use LLM to solve calculations
- Handle non-math queries gracefully

**3 TODOs:**
- **Line 40:** Router condition: `if state["is_math"]:`
- **Line 51:** Return result: `return {"result": f"Answer: {answer}"}`
- **Line 76:** Map routing: `"calculator": "calculator"`

**Key Learning:** Tools are just nodes with specific functions, LLM can act as calculator

---

### Task 7: Research Agent 🔬
**File:** `task_7_research_agent.py` (146 lines)

**Concept:** Complete assistant with multiple tools

**What You'll Do:**
- Initialize DuckDuckGo search
- Classify queries as math or search
- Route to calculator for math

- Build a complete research assistant!

**3 TODOs:**
- **Line 28:** Initialize search: `ddgs = DDGS()`
- **Line 59:** Return result: `return {"result": f"Calculation result: {answer}"}`
- **Line 67:** Search web: `results = ddgs.text(state["query"], max_results=2)`

**Key Learning:** Smart routing between multiple tools based on query type

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Progressive Learning Path
```
Task 1: Imports        → Foundation setup
       ↓
Task 2: Nodes          → State transformation
       ↓
Task 3: Edges          → Connect nodes
       ↓
Task 4: Complete Flow  → Multi-step workflow
       ↓
Task 5: Routing        → Dynamic decisions
       ↓
Task 6: Calculator     → LLM integration
       ↓
Task 7: Research Agent → Multiple tools
```

### Why This Progressive Approach?
- **Start Simple:** Begin with imports, not complex examples
- **Build Understanding:** Each task adds ONE new concept
- **No LLM Until Ready:** Tasks 1-5 use simple strings
- **Gradual Complexity:** From 44 to 146 lines progressively
- **Real Achievement:** End with a working research agent!
